#Twitter Clone Mini - Project

You will be making a Twitter Clone one more time :)

###Requirements:

###Phase 1:

* Your homepage should show all Tweets in the database
* A user can create a new Tweet
* A user can edit Tweets
* A user can delete Tweets
* A user can view more information about one specific Tweet

It's up to you to decide what information you want to store on your model.  Do not worry about a User model just yet.  Just work on getting Tweets to work.  Anyone can create, edit, and delete Tweets for now.


###Phase 2:

* Add a user model - you ca do this with Devise
* Add authorization - make users log in in order to use your app
* Change your index page - it should now display the tweets that belong to the current user

###Phase 3:

* Add styling - you can use bootstrap
* Extra challenge - try and style your app to look like twitter

###Phase 4:
* Add a hastag model. Think very carefully about the relationship of hashtags to tweets
* Add hash tag functionality. 
  - Things to think about: How will you create hashtags when a user creates a tweet? How will you display hashtags?

**Bonus: Once you have those basic features done, work on adding some of these features:**
* Display other users tweets, but only allow user to edit/delete there own
* Pagination
* Search for Tweets
